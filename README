This trivial program takes a wav file and looks for large blocks of
silence.  If it finds these blocks, it splits the file into new files
that doesn't containt these silences.

The raison d'etre here is that lots and lots and lots of CDs have
"hidden tracks" tacked on to the end of the last track.  There's
typically the last listed song, and then there's ten minutes of
silence, and then there's the "hidden" track.

It gets boring really fast.

Hence this program.

You need libsndfile (version 1.x) to compile this program.  It's
only been compiled under Debian GNU/Linux, and your mileage may vary.

Parameters:
  --length: The minimum number of seconds of silence a block of silence is.
            Default 60.
  --silence: How silent silence is.  The default value is 5.
  --pattern: sprintf pattern to use when creating output files.  The default
  	     value is "unsilence-%02d.wav".

If a block of silence was found, the command returns true.  If not,
false.
